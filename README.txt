Hi,

Thanks for buying this template. I hope you find it useful.

Here's an overview of how this template is structured. If you have any doubts, drop me an email at bharani@bootstrapcarnival.com and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

1. The CSS for this template is written using SCSS. You can find the SCSS files in /sass folder. 
    1. Inside the sass folder, you'll see a file called styles.scss. This is the file where that imports all other partials.
    2. The modules/_config.scss file contains the color and font variables used in this template. Customize them to suit your needs.
    3 modules/_overrides_.scss contains the bootstrap overrides
    4. modules/components folder has the scss rules for common components like headers, modal windows etc. 
    5. Inside modules/_header.scss you'll find styling for 2 types of nav menus - 'navbar-white' and 'navbar-translucent'
    6. There is a separate scss partial for each screen inside the pages folder.

2. The javascript used in this template is included inside the 'javascripts' folder. The vendor folder has all the external plugins used by this template. app.js is the file with template specific functions. In production, you might want to compress and minify all the javascript files together. Alternately, you can also choose to include only those js files that are used on a specific page. You'll find comments next to each js script tag that mentions the use of that javascript file. 

3. NOTE: I have created this template using a tool called Serve (http://get-serve.com/). It automatically compiles compass/sass and helps you create static pages. If you want the original source code (with views, partials and layouts), drop me an email. If you plan to use this with a framework like Rails or Sinatra, it might save you some time.
